/*
 * Instead of using java.io.File class to handle a disk file, 
 * it is better to use java.net.URL. URL is more flexible and 
 * can handle files from more sources, such as disk file 
 * and JAR file (used for distributing your program).
 *  It works on application as well as applet. 
 *  Example:-3.1-LOADï¿½NG IMAGES
